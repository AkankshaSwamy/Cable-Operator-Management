In this example, the HTML form sends user input to signup_process.php using the POST method. The PHP script processes the form data, performs basic validation (you should implement stronger validation in a real application), and then inserts the new user's information into a database. Make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual database connection details and table schema.

Remember, this example is simplified and lacks security measures. In a real-world scenario, you should use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection, hash and salt passwords for security, and implement additional validation and error handling.
